Bike Share Case Study

By: Michael Felipe

Date: January 11th, 2022

------------------------

This analysis is for a fictional bike sharing company, Cyclistic.
the business task at hand is to figure out how to make their casual riders, customers without annual membership, into Cyclistic members, cutomers with annual memberships.

Three questions will guide the future marketing program: 
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently? 
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members? 

We will be examining the first question:
How do annual member and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

We will be using RStudio for this analysis because the dataset is too large for Excel.

-------------------

First we must load the correct packages to clean and filter the data and to load the .csv file.

install.package("tidyverse")
instal.package("
